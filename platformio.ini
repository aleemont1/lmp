; ESP-IDF environment for PlatformIO (primary build target)
[env:heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3]
platform = espressif32
board = heltec_wifi_lora_32_V3
framework = espidf
monitor_speed = 115200

[env:native]
platform = native
; Use the Unity test framework
test_framework = unity
; Add include path so tests can find component headers
build_flags =

; 1. Force PlatformIO to consider project sources for the test build
test_build_src = true

; 2. Define exactly which source files to compile for the native env.
;    We include the Serializer (logic) and the Mock implementation (packet_impl.cpp).
;    We EXCLUDE src/main.cpp (conflicting main) and Packet.cpp (esp_log dependency).
